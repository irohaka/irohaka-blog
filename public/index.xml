      <description>Hugo 0.57.0 had some well-intended breaking changes. And while they made a lot of sense, one of them made a little too much noise.
This release reverts the behavior for .Pages on the home page to how it behaved in 0.56, but adds a WARNING telling you what to do to prepare for Hugo 0.58.
In short, .Page home will from 0.58 only return its immediate children (sections and regular pages).</description>
